# Penguin-Corps-screensaver

The Penguin Corps of Aspen Academy in Minnesota is doing amazing work introducing students to Linux but also helping their fellow students by outfitting computers with Linux for their community.  You can read more about their work at https://aspenacademymn.org/penguin-corps/ - please reach out to them if you have computers you would otherwise be disposing of so they can repurpose them (and learn more about Linux along the way).

As a tribute to what they are doing, I have written this little screensaver that is designed to work perfectly with Xubuntu 20.04.  To install:

* Download the Git repo to the Downloads folder.
* Right click and select to Open Terminal Here.
* Copy and paste this into the Terminal Emulator:

```sudo cp PenguinCorps.desktop /usr/share/applications/screensavers/PenguinCorps.desktop && sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/screensavers/PenguinCorps.desktop && sudo cp PenguinCorps.png /usr/share/pixmaps/PenguinCorps.png```

(It will ask for the sudo password.)

Once installed, the Penguin Corps screensaver can be set in the screensaver options.

This was written for Xubuntu 20.04.
